 BinPacker is an efficient de novo trascriptome assembler for RNA-Seq data. It can assemble 
 all transcripts from short reads (single or paired) without using a reference.  
 The software expects as input RNA-Seq reads in fasta or fastq format, and ouput all
 assembled candidate transcripts in fasta format. Briefly, it works in two step: first,
 BinPacker partitions the sequence data into many individual splicing graphs, each capturing 
 the full transcriptional complexity at a given gene or no more than a few genes. Then, 
 BinPacker uses variants of the traditional bins packing model to search for minimum edge-path-cover
 over the splicng graph that can be supported by our data and could explain all observed 
 splicing events of each locus.

 This software is free to use, modify, redistribute without any restrictions,

 Installation
================


 1. Installing Boost

    a) download a version of boost and unpack it.

       $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.47.0/boost_1_47_0.tar.gz

       $ tar zxvf boost_1_47_0.tar.gz

    b) change to the boost directory and run ./bootstrap.sh.

       $ cd  boost_1_47_0
       $ ./bootstrap.sh

    c) run 

       $ ./b2 install --prefix=<YOUR_BOOST_INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
       
       For example,if you want install boost in /home/juntaosdu/local/boost,the commnd is :
       $ ./b2 install --prefix=/home/juntaosdu/local/boost

       If the boost is installed successfully, you would fild two sub-directories in /home/juntaosdu/local/boost/:
       /home/juntaosdu/local/boost/include/
       /home/juntaosdu/local/boost/lib/

      Note: The default Boost installation directory is /usr/local. Take note of the boost installation
       directory, beacuase you need to tell the BinPacker installer where to find boost later on.
 
    d) Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variable:

       The ~/.bash_profile ($HOME/.bash_profile) or ~/.profile file is executed when you login using console or remotely using ssh.
       Append the following command to  ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile file:
       $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/juntaosdu/local/boost/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

       Save and close the file.

       OR

       just type the command:
       $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/juntaosdu/local/boost/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

       Note: please replace "/home/juntaosdu/local/boost/lib" with your own directory "<YOUR_BOOST_INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/lib"
       If you do not set this variable , you would possible see the follwoing error information:
        "error while loading shared libraries: libboost_serialization.so.1.47.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"


 2. Building BinPacker
  
    a) Unpack the BinPacker and change to the BinPacker direcotry.

       $ tar zxvf BinPacker_1.0.tar.gz
       $ cd BinPacker_1.0

    b) Configure BinPacker. If Boost is installed somewhere other than /usr/local, you will need to tell
       the installer where to find it using --with-boost option.

       $ ./configure --with-boost=/path/to/boost/

       For example, if your boost was installed in /home/juntaosdu/local/boost,the commnd is :
       $ ./configure --with-boost=/home/juntaosdu/local/boost

    c) Make BinPacker.

       $ make 


 3. Test the installation. Test data are provided with sofeware distribution in the sample_test directory.

     $ ./runMe.sh

BinPacker v1.0 usage:
    
** Required **
    
-s <string>: type of reads: ( fa or fq ).

-p <string>: type of sequencing: ( pair or single ).
    
If paired_end reads:
   -l <string>: left reads.
   -r <string>: right reads.
    
If single_end reads:
   -u <string>: single reads.
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
** Options **
    
-o <string>: name of directory for output, default: ./BinPacker_Out_Dir/
    
-m <string>: strand-specific RNA-Seq reads orientation, default: double_stranded_mode.
             if paired_end: RF or FR;
             if single_end: F or R.
    
-k <int>: length of kmer, default:25.
    
-g <int>: gap length of paired reads, default: 200.
    
-S <int>: minimum coverage of kmer as a seed, default: 2.
    
-E <float>: minimum entropy of kmer as a seed, default: 1.5.
    
-C <int>: minimum coverage of kmer used to extend, default: 1.
    
-N <float>: minimum entroy of kmer used to extend, default: 0.0.
    
-J <int>: minimum of the coverage of a junction, default: 2.
    
-v: report the current version of BinPacker and exit.
    
** Note **
A typical command of BinPacker might be:
    
BinPacker -s fq -p pair -l reads.left.fq -r reads.right.fq
    
(If your data are strand-strand, it is recommended to set -m option.)
